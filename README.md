# Faculty-StudentManagementSystem
Faculty &amp; Students Management System is a distributed application, developed to maintain the details of Faculties working in the college and students records taking education in that college. It is designed to store and manage studentâ€™s marks of complete academic year. The application is actually a suite of applications developed using Java.  This software application stores all the faculty &amp; students information in a database. It is an application developed in Java GUI technology and database used is SQL. It contains faculty information like Faculty id, Faculty Name and their login password. It is an easy to use application and has a user-friendly interface. It is totally built at the administrative end which means that only the admin has access rights to add or remove faculty and student, where as faculty has the right to modify or add students marks. So this makes it safe and reliable application to use. The main aim of developing this application was to reduce the errors that occur in the manual system. Student can search the his marks easily by just entering his/her roll number and batch. In earlier systems, there was not such a facility to do so.
